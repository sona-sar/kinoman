# ðŸŽ¬ Kinoman: Movie + Trivia Game
This is a web game where you guess actors from random movies and unlock bonus trivia questions when you're on a roll. Built with React and MUI.

ðŸ‘‰ Play it directly [here](https://kinoman-trivia.vercel.app/).

## ðŸ•¹ How It Works
- A random movie poster appears  
- You type an actor's name from that movie  
- Get it right? Score points  
- Get 2 in a row? Answer a bonus true/false trivia question

Simple as that.
